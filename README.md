# SMS Spam Detection using NLP

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It preprocesses SMS data and applies machine learning models to classify messages as spam or non-spam.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal
- Machine learning models: Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest
- High accuracy and precision in spam detection

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset diversity
- Use advanced NLP embeddings like BERT or Word2Vec
- Add real-time spam trend adaptation
